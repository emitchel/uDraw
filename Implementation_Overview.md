#####Required Features

1. Users will be able to draw on a blank canvas (whiteboard).

  Completed

2. Users will be able to erase what has been drawn.

  Completed - Admittedly, not a legit eraser, just white paint, with the idea being the canvas or "whiteboard" is always white on the other side and anything plastered on, be it marker or image, can be erased to expose the whiteness of the board. 
 
3. Users will be able to undo and redo drawing paths.

  Completed

4. Users will be able to draw using a color of their choice from at least 
these colors: black, dark gray, light gray, blue, red, green, orange, yellow.

  Completed - The color view is a horizontal scroll view, orange and yellow might be out of view, be sure to scroll to the right to view all.

5. Users will be able to capture a screen shot and email it to a friend.

Completed

#####Optional Features

- Users will want to set the thickness of the drawing tool.

  Included

- Users will want to draw on top of a photo theyâ€™ve taken (or take a new photo), for example to draw a funny mustache on a selfie.

  Included although the image may not maintain aspect ratio and may be rotated (Added rotate feature for this reason). Would require additional time to address these issues.

- Users will want to watch the playback of their drawing happen.

  Added a playback of paths drawn and not the exact points. Would require additional time to implement a per point implementation.

- Users will want to place and resize predefined shapes (vectors) on screen

  Did not include.
